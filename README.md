# RGL - My OpenGL Engine



## Building and Compiling
Open a terminal, then navigate to the bin folder.

```bash
cd bin
```

Execute the Makefile using your preferred build tool. (I'm using MinGW)
```bash
mingw32-make
```
The executable should then open itself.

## Usage
```bash
W - Move Up
A - Move Left
S - Move Down

Q - Move Back
E - Move Forward

ARROW UP - Rotate around +X
ARROW DOWN - Rotate around -X
ARROW LEFT - Rotate around +Y
ARROW RIGHT - Rotate around -Y
K - Rotate around +Z
L - Rotate around -Z

ESCAPE - Exit Application
```
